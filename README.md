### JupyterNotebook
An open-source web application that allows us to create and share documents that contain live-code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. 

### GoogleCollab
Google Colab (Collaboratory) is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment provided by Google. It provides free access to "GPU" (Graphics processing unit) and "TPU" (Tensor Processing Unit) resources, making it an excellent choice for machine learning and deep learning projects.

### Prerequisites
1.  A Google Account (required to use Google Colab).
2.  A modern web browser (Google Chrome is recommended for best performance).

## Installation and Setup
1.  You don't need to install anything to use Google Colab as it runs entirely in your web browser.
2.  Installation of Anaconda and setting up Jupyter Notebook within the Anaconda environment.
   ### Download and Install Anaconda
   1.   Visit Anaconda download page, https://www.anaconda.com/download
   2.   Choose the appropriate Anaconda distribution for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Select the Python 3.x version (e.g., Python 3.7) as it is recommended for most users.
   3.   Download and proceed with the installation.
